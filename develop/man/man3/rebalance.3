rebalance \- Rebalance 
The \fBWT_SESSION::rebalance\fP method can be used to rebalance data sources' underlying btrees\&. If a tree has become unbalanced (that is, one part of the tree is excessively deep), \fBWT_SESSION::rebalance\fP rewrites the tree as a balanced tree\&.
.PP
The data source must be quiescent\&.
.PP
The \fBWT_SESSION::rebalance\fP method should never be needed, as WiredTiger btrees are maintained as balanced trees\&. It is only provided as a tool to handle the unexpected\&.
