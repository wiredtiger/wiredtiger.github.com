error_handling_lang_java \- Error handling in Java 
WiredTiger operations return a value of 0 on success and a non-zero value on error\&. Error codes may be either positive or negative: positive error codes are standard error codes as described for POSIX-like systems (for example, EINVAL or EBUSY), negative error codes are WiredTiger-specific (for example, WT_ROLLBACK)\&.
.PP
WiredTiger-specific error codes always appear in the -31,800 to -31,999 range\&.
.PP
Informational return values, like \fCwiredtiger\&.WT_NOTFOUND\fP or \fCwiredtiger\&.WT_DUPLICATE_KEY\fP or 0 (success), are directly returned by APIs\&. More severe errors are thrown as \fCWiredTigerException\fP, which may be caught by the application\&.
.PP
The \fCWiredTigerRollbackException\fP is a specific type of \fCWiredTigerException\fP, it is thrown when there is a conflict between concurrent operations\&. An application that catches this exception should call rollback() on the relevant transaction, and retry as necessary\&.
.PP
The \fCWiredTigerPanicException\fP is a specific type of \fCWiredTigerException\fP, it is thrown when there is an underlying problem that requires the application to exit and restart\&.
.PP
The following is a complete list of possible WiredTiger-specific return values, all constants defined in the com\&.wiredtiger\&.db\&.wiredtiger class:
.PP
\fBWT_ROLLBACK\fP
.RS 4
This error is generated when an operation cannot be completed due to a conflict with concurrent operations\&. The operation may be retried; if a transaction is in progress, it should be rolled back and the operation retried in a new transaction\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBWT_DUPLICATE_KEY\fP
.RS 4
This error is generated when the application attempts to insert a record with the same key as an existing record without the 'overwrite' configuration to Session\&.open_cursor\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBWT_ERROR\fP
.RS 4
This error is returned when an error is not covered by a specific error return\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBWT_NOTFOUND\fP
.RS 4
This error indicates an operation did not find a value to return\&. This includes cursor search and other operations where no record matched the cursor's search key such as Cursor\&.update or Cursor\&.remove\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBWT_PANIC\fP
.RS 4
This error indicates an underlying problem that requires the application exit and restart\&. The application can exit immediately when \fCWT_PANIC\fP is returned from a WiredTiger interface, no further WiredTiger calls are required\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBWT_RUN_RECOVERY\fP
.RS 4
This error is generated when wiredtiger_open is configured to return an error if recovery is required to use the database\&.
.RE
.PP
The \fBwiredtiger_strerror\fP function returns the standard message associated with any WiredTiger, ISO C99, or POSIX 1003\&.1-2001 function:
.PP
.PP
.nf
    try {
        String key = "non-existent key";
        cursor\&.putKeyString(key);
        if ((ret = cursor\&.remove()) != 0) {
            System\&.err\&.println(
                "cursor\&.remove: " + wiredtiger\&.wiredtiger_strerror(ret));
            return (ret);
        }
    } catch (WiredTigerException wte) {  /* Catch severe errors\&. */
        System\&.err\&.println("cursor\&.remove exception: " + wte);
    }
.fi
