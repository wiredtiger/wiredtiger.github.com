tune_close \- Connection close 
Closing a \fBWT_CONNECTION\fP:: handle can be expensive, in part because of the cost of freeing memory (for example, the memory allocated for a large cache)\&. If the process is exiting regardless, configuring \fBWT_CONNECTION::close\fP to leak memory on close can significantly speed up the close\&.
.PP
An example of configuring \fBWT_CONNECTION::close\fP to leak memory:
.PP
.PP
.nf
        ret = conn->close(conn, "leak_memory=true");
.fi
