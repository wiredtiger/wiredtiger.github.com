<tr>
<th>Term</th><th>Category</th><th>Definition </th></tr>
<tr>
<td>address cookie</td><td>block manager</td><td>an opaque set of bytes returned by the block manager to reference a block in a Btree file, it includes an offset, size, checksum, and object id. </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>atomicity</td><td>transactions</td><td>a guarantee provided within the context of a transaction that all operations made within that transaction either succeed or fail. </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>barrier</td><td>general</td><td>a call that forces the CPU and compiler to enforce ordering constraints on memory operations, used in multithreaded code. </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>block</td><td>block manager</td><td>the smallest granularity of data that is read from or written to a Btree file. A btree page, when it appears on disk, may consist of one or more blocks. </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>block compression</td><td>btree</td><td>after pages of btrees are encoded to be written, they may be compressed according to a configured algorithm. Compressors may be added to WiredTiger via the extension mechanism. </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>block manager</td><td>block manager</td><td>an internal API that abstracts writing, reading and allocating blocks to and from files. A block manager is associated with a Btree. </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Bloom filter</td><td>lsm</td><td>a data structure that identifies that a key cannot be present. Used by LSM. </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>btree</td><td>btree</td><td>a data structure on disk or in memory that stores keys, it with its associated value. In WiredTiger, all btrees are in fact B+trees, meaning that adjacent keys and values are grouped into pages. </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>bulk insert</td><td>btree</td><td>the capability to rapidly insert a set of ordered key value pairs into a Btree. In WiredTiger, a Btree's dhandle must be obtained exclusively, guaranteeing that the inserts can be done single threaded. </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>cell</td><td>file format</td><td>a key or value packed as it appears on disk for a Btree. </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>checkpoint</td><td>checkpoint</td><td>a stable point that bounds how much work recovery must do. Data committed before a checkpoint is guaranteed to reside in data files. Thus, recovery must replay log files starting at the last completed checkpoint. </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>chunk</td><td>lsm</td><td>a single file within an LSM tree. </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>collator</td><td>general</td><td>a comparison function that determines how keys will be ordered in a Btree. The default collator is byte oriented. A custom collator may be packaged as an extension and attached to a Btree. </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>column</td><td>schema</td><td>a single field in a record, which must be unpacked from a raw key or value. </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>column group</td><td>schema</td><td>a set of column store Btrees, whose record ids logically correspond. Together, a column group represents a table of data, with its columns being the union of columns in the individual Btrees. </td></tr>

<td>column store</td><td>btree</td><td>a Btrees that has as its key a record id </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>commit timestamp</td><td>transactions</td><td>values in this transaction become visible at this timestamp. </td></tr>

<tr>
<td>isolation</td><td>transactions</td><td>determines which versions of data are visible to a running transaction, and whether it can see changes made by concurrently running transactions. </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>key prefix compression</td><td>btree</td><td>a technique to store identical key prefixes only once per page. See <a class="el" href="file_formats.html#file_formats_compression">File formats and compression</a> </td></tr>
<tr>

<tr>
<td>mutex</td><td>general</td><td>a locking algorithm that waits, allowing other threads to execute, when the lock cannot be immediately acquired, and is woken to retry when the lock is available. Although more heavyweight than a spin lock, it consumes fewer resources while waiting. Appropriate for resources that may be in contention and may be held for longer periods. </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>object id</td><td>tiered storage</td><td>an integer that indicates an individual file that is a part of a Btree. </td></tr>
<tr>

<tr>
<td>recno</td><td>general</td><td>a 64 bit integer. When used as a key, the Btree is said to be a column store, and the keys are assigned incrementally by WiredTiger when new records are inserted. </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>reconcile</td><td>general</td><td>convert the in-memory version of a page to a more compact form for file storage. </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>recovery</td><td>general</td><td>a procedure used on opening WiredTiger whereby, starting at the last checkpoint written, log records are played back to bring the database up to date. </td></tr>

<tr>
<td>stable timestamp</td><td>transactions</td><td>a connection-wide value. Checkpoints will not include commits newer than this value. </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>table</td><td>schema</td><td>an abstraction that allows one or more btrees to be used in a coordinated way, which is specified by the schema. The table coordinates indices and column groups. </td></tr>
<tr>
