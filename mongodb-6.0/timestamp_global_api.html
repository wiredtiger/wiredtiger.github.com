<div class="textblock"><p>Applications using timestamps need to manage the global timestamp state. These timestamps are queried using the <a class="el" href="struct_w_t___c_o_n_n_e_c_t_i_o_n.html#a607cf2781661d03ba50586133e02cc11" title="Query the global transaction timestamp state.">WT_CONNECTION::query_timestamp</a> method and set using the <a class="el" href="struct_w_t___c_o_n_n_e_c_t_i_o_n.html#ad082439541b1b95d6aae6c15026fe512" title="Set a global transaction timestamp.">WT_CONNECTION::set_timestamp</a> method.</p>
<p>Applications will generally focus on two of these global timestamps: first, the beginning of the database's read window, called <code>oldest_timestamp</code>, and second, the application time at which data is known to be stable and will never be rolled back, called <code>stable_timestamp</code>.</p>
<p>The oldest timestamp is the oldest time at which a transaction is allowed to read. The historic values of data modified before this time can no longer be read by new transactions. (Transactions already in progress are not affected when the <code>oldest_timestamp</code> changes.)</p>
<p>The stable timestamp is the earliest time at which data is considered stable. (Data is said to be stable when it is not only durable, but additionally, transactions committed at or before the stable time cannot be rolled back by application-level transaction management.) The stable timestamp is saved along with every checkpoint, and that saved time is the point to which the database is recovered after a crash. It is also the earliest point to which the database can be returned via an explicit <a class="el" href="struct_w_t___c_o_n_n_e_c_t_i_o_n.html#a93dbc74accb426582b3c5c2f69e04b28" title="Rollback tables to an earlier point in time, discarding all updates to checkpoint durable tables that...">WT_CONNECTION::rollback_to_stable</a> call. (See <a class="el" href="timestamp_misc.html#timestamp_misc_rts">Using rollback-to-stable with timestamps</a>.) All transactions must commit after the current <code>stable</code> timestamp.</p>
<p>Applications are responsible for managing these timestamps and periodically updating them. Applications must move both timestamps forward relative to the amount of data being written; not updating them can result in pinning large amounts of data in the cache, which can in turn affect application performance.</p>
<p>Note that updating the stable timestamp does not itself trigger a database checkpoint or change data durability; updates before the new stable timestamp become stable (and thus visible after recovery) as part of the next checkpoint.</p>

<h2><a class="anchor" id="timestamp_global_set_api_durable_timestamp"></a>
Setting the global "durable_timestamp" timestamp</h2>
<p>The global <code>durable_timestamp</code> functions as application input into the timestamp returned by querying the <code>all_durable</code> timestamp (see below). It is not otherwise used; in particular, moving it forward does not force data to disk. To force data to disk, advance the stable timestamp as desired and take a checkpoint.</p>
<dl class="section warning"><dt>Warning</dt><dd>The <code>durable_timestamp</code> is not changed when the application calls the <a class="el" href="struct_w_t___c_o_n_n_e_c_t_i_o_n.html#a93dbc74accb426582b3c5c2f69e04b28" title="Rollback tables to an earlier point in time, discarding all updates to checkpoint durable tables that...">WT_CONNECTION::rollback_to_stable</a> method, and should be reset by the application in that case.</dd></dl>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="timestamp_global_set_api_oldest_timestamp"></a>
Setting the "oldest_timestamp" timestamp</h2>
<p>Setting <code>oldest_timestamp</code> indicates future read timestamps will be at least as recent as the timestamp, allowing WiredTiger to discard history before the specified point. It is not required that there be no currently active readers at earlier timestamps: this setting only indicates future application needs. In other words, as active readers age out of the system, historic data up to the oldest timestamp will be discarded, but no historic data at or after the <code>oldest</code> timestamp will be discarded. It is critical the application update the oldest timestamp frequently as retaining history can be expensive in terms of both cache and I/O resources.</p>
<p>During recovery, the <code>oldest_timestamp</code> is set to its value as of the checkpoint to which recovery is done.</p>
<p>Attempting to set the <code>oldest_timestamp</code> to a value earlier than its current value will be silently ignored.</p>
<p>The <code>oldest_timestamp</code> must be less than or equal to the <code>stable_timestamp</code>.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="timestamp_global_set_api_stable_timestamp"></a>
Setting the "stable_timestamp" timestamp</h2>
<p>The <code>stable_timestamp</code> determines the timestamp for subsequent checkpoints. In other words, updates to an object after the stable timestamp will not be included in a future checkpoint. Because tables in a timestamp world are generally using checkpoint durability, the <code>stable_timestamp</code> also determines the point to which recovery will be done after failures.</p>
<p>During recovery, the <code>stable_timestamp</code> is set to the value to which recovery is performed.</p>
<p>It is possible to explicitly roll back to a time after, or equal to, the current <code>stable_timestamp</code> using the <a class="el" href="struct_w_t___c_o_n_n_e_c_t_i_o_n.html#a93dbc74accb426582b3c5c2f69e04b28" title="Rollback tables to an earlier point in time, discarding all updates to checkpoint durable tables that...">WT_CONNECTION::rollback_to_stable</a> method. (See <a class="el" href="timestamp_misc.html#timestamp_misc_rts">Using rollback-to-stable with timestamps</a>.)</p>
<p>The <code>stable_timestamp</code> should be updated frequently as it generally determines work to be done after recovery to bring the system online, as well as allowing WiredTiger to write data from the cache, and for that reason will affect overall performance.</p>
<p>Attempting to set the <code>stable_timestamp</code> to a value earlier than its current value will be silently ignored.</p>
<p>Using the stable timestamp in the checkpoint is not required, and can be overridden using the <code>use_timestamp=false</code> configuration of the <a class="el" href="struct_w_t___s_e_s_s_i_o_n.html#a6550c9079198955c5071583941c85bbf" title="Write a transactionally consistent snapshot of a database or set of individual objects.">WT_SESSION::checkpoint</a> call. This is not intended for general use, but can be useful for backup scenarios where rolling back to a stable timestamp isn't possible and it's useful for a checkpoint to contain the most recent possible data.</p>

Forcing global timestamps</h2>

For example, this can be used to move <code>stable_timestamp</code> backward. Violating these constraints can lead to undefined or incorrect behavior. For example, while moving <code>oldest_timestamp</code> backward with this mechanism may make some historical data accessible again, other obsolete historical data may have already been discarded, and no guarantees of consistency are made.</dd></dl>

<p>The <code>last_checkpoint</code> timestamp is the stable timestamp of the previous checkpoint (or 0 if no checkpoints have run).
